Web VR Twitter World
========

An updated version of [VR Twitter World](https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/VRTwitterWorld) that uses WebVR. 

This is a demo using Three.js to create a visualisation of real time tweets as particles. In order to get this to run, you'll need to create a config.json file like so with your Twitter API credentials:

```
{
  "consumer_key": "YOURKEY",
  "consumer_secret": "YOURKEYSECRET",
  "token": "YOURTOKEN",
  "token_secret": "YOURTOKENSECRET"
}
```

If you make a really nice visualisation from this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com.

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I've got a range of different IoT/wearable/VR/AR demos up there!

I've also got a site dedicated to developer resources for emerging tech like the IoT, wearables, VR, AR and artificial intelligence over at http://www.devdiner.com :)
